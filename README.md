Just oss plugins I made for Aurora out of their suggestions channel in their discord.

To use BuilderTools, download the folder as a zip, extract it, open the .csproj (you will need visual studio installed)
on the top right in visual studio, you will see the build tab, click it and press build solution, or you can open the bin folder and copy BuilderTools.dll
and paste it in your ServerPlugins folder. In game you can get the tools by typing /buildertools or /btools.
